### Hello World! 👋

- 😄 My name is Octávio Lage, and I'm from Brazil :earth_americas:. Since was young, I always thought it was amazing how pulses of energy were transformed into what we see every day on the screens of our computers and video games. So I decided to work turning these pulses into something to help people.

- :books: I am currently in the third period of my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais.

- :computer: Actually I work as a Software Development Inner at Mediar Solutions.

- ✉️ Would you like to find me?
