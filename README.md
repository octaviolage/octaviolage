### Hello World! 👋

- 😄 My name is Octávio Lage, and I'm from Brazil :earth_americas:. Since was young, I always thought it was amazing how pulses of energy were transformed into what we see every day on the screens of our computers and video games. So I decided to work on turning these pulses into things that can help people in different ways.

- 📚 I am currently in the third period of my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais.
- 💻 Actually I work as a Software Development Inner at Mediar Solutions.
- 🎲 Quick facts about me: The thing I like to do the most is to get to know new things and places. My favorite food is pizza. My favorite sport is running. In my spare time I like to play games.

- ✉️ Would you like to find me?
